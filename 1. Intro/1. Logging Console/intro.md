LOGGING TO THE CONSOLE IN JS
Now that you've spent some time in Python, it's time to branch out and learn a new programming language: JavaScript! Don't worry, learning programming languages is not like learning natural languages. The second programming language you learn takes roughly 10% of the effort that the first one took, because so many of the concepts are the same - usually the syntax is just a bit different.

LET'S BUILD THE BACK-END OF A MOVIE REVIEW APP
For the next few chapters we'll create the building blocks of a back-end web server. The purpose of the server will be to supply up-to date information about the state of our Movie review mobile app: "MovieStarz". For example, the server will:

Store user information (emails, names, passwords)
Provide authentication mechanisms
Store movie reviews
Recommend movies based on choices
Etc.
PRINTING TO THE CONSOLE IN JAVASCRIPT
In Python, we used print() to print text. In JavaScript, we use console.log(), and we typically denote strings using single quotes:

console.log('this text will be printed')
Copy icon
ASSIGNMENT
Print Starting MovieStarz server to the console.
